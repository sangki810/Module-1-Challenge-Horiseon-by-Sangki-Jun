# Module 1 Challenge: Horiseon by Sangki Jun
## Description
 This website was created and launched as the completed assignment for the module 1 challenge from week 1 of UCF FSF Coding Bootcamp, 2022. The purpose of this website was for the creator to practice using semantic HTML language and concise CSS on an existing starter code. The given codes used generic "div" elements to implement the HTML structure while using repeated CSS codes to deploy a site that looked exactly the same as the site from this repository. Among many other requirements, the main assignment was to change all "div" elements from the previous code into a  more semantic HTML language, and match the CSS to work with the new HTML elements. As keeping the look of the original website while changing the codes was a part of the challenge, the deployed site cannot be distinguished from the original given site. Many changes were made from the original code into this one to update the less coherent codes into a more decipherable agile code base.
